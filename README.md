## About the Project

In this project, you will explore foundational deep learning calculations and neural network mechanics, with a hands-on approach to matrix manipulation and feedforward networks. These exercises provide the basis for understanding artificial neural networks (ANNs) by breaking down key components of network computation.

## Dependencies

- **Numpy**: Used for matrix operations and mathematical computations essential for neural network calculations.

## Exercises

1. **Matrix Calculation**:

   - Explore basic matrix operations essential to ANN calculations.
   - Topics include matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and more.

2. **Calculating ANN Output**:

   - Compute the output of a simple artificial neural network using feedforward propagation.
   - Includes functions for activation and applying weights to inputs.

3. **Training ANN Using Spreadsheet**:
   - Practice readsheet.
   - Understand weight adjustments, error calculations, antraining an ANN with calculations manually performed in a spd backpropagation concepts.
